We will begin by compiling starter information encompassing the current knowledge in the space.
Upon familiarizing ourself with the current knowledge base, we will 
    [ ] seek to expand our knowledge by filling in gaps in our understanding
    [ ] or attack a possible solution until failure.

These hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere attrition, 
epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing,
mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, 
and altered intercellular communication


GPT outlined a decent strategy for learning. I will begin with its foundational recommendations:
Biology of Aging: Familiarize yourself with the biological mechanisms of aging. Textbooks like "Molecular Biology of Aging" by Leonard Guarente and "The Biology of Aging: Observations and Principles" by Robert Arking are great starting points.
Cellular Senescence: Learn about cellular senescence, the process where cells cease to divide and accumulate with age, contributing to aging and age-related diseases.
