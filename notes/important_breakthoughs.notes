isolated cow or human adrenal gland cells inserted into immunodeficient mice formed functional adrenal tissue that resembles normal adrenal gland. This approach may potentially be used for any organ, either to study its functional regeneration in a living organism with age or to therapeutically regenerate lost function as in a case, for example, when defective genes might be replaced in cells isolated from a patient and then placed back into the same patient for tissue regeneration
