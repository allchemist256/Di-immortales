Getting started in the field of aging research is both exciting and challenging, given the rapid advancements and the depth of knowledge required. Here are some recommendations to help you jump right in:

Understanding the Basics
Foundational Knowledge:
Biology of Aging: Familiarize yourself with the biological mechanisms of aging. Textbooks like "Molecular Biology of Aging" by Leonard Guarente and "The Biology of Aging: Observations and Principles" by Robert Arking are great starting points.
Cellular Senescence: Learn about cellular senescence, the process where cells cease to divide and accumulate with age, contributing to aging and age-related diseases.
Key Researchers and Institutions:
Dr. David Sinclair: A leading figure in aging research, known for his work on sirtuins and NAD+. Read his book "Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don't Have To" for an overview of his theories.
Institutions: Harvard Medical School, Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and SENS Research Foundation are prominent institutions conducting significant aging research.
Prominent Papers and Reviews
To get a comprehensive overview of the current landscape, here are some highly regarded review papers and articles:

"The Hallmarks of Aging" by Carlos López-Otín, Maria A. Blasco, Linda Partridge, Manuel Serrano, and Guido Kroemer. This seminal paper outlines nine hallmarks that represent common denominators of aging in various organisms. (Cell, 2013)
"NAD+ in Aging, Metabolism, and Neurodegeneration" by Eric Verdin. This review discusses the role of NAD+ in aging and its potential therapeutic applications. (Science, 2015)
"Mitochondria in Aging and Disease" by Nils-Göran Larsson. This paper reviews the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and age-related diseases. (Cell, 2010)
"Senescence, SASP, and Cancer" by Judith Campisi. This article explores the role of senescent cells and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in cancer and aging. (Annual Review of Physiology, 2013)
"The Role of Epigenetics in Aging and Age-Related Diseases" by Benedetta Stazi, Giulia Migliore, et al. This review focuses on the impact of epigenetic changes in aging and potential therapeutic targets. (Biogerontology, 2021)
