- Telomeres are highly repetitive DNA sequences located at the end of chromosomes, and telomere length is associated with cell age. As cells divide, telomere length gets progressively shorter until eventually, proliferation stops entirely. Such cells, which have ceased dividing, are called senescent.
- Percieved antiquated hallmarks of aging: 
These hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere attrition, 
epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing,
mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, 
and altered intercellular communication
- nuclei from senescent bovine fibroblasts were transferred into egg cells from which the nucleus had been removed. The nuclei were reactivated and the egg cells were implanted into cows. Healthy calves were born, and were found to have telomere lengths that are more typical of young than old animals. Thus, telomere length was reset during gestation
